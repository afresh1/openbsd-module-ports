openbsd-module-ports
====================

A framework to generate OpenBSD ports for thinks like ruby gems and perl modules

This is a very rough work in progress still.
There are many things it doesn't do yet but for me, it is better than nothing.

TODO
====

* pkg/DESCR
* `make makesum`
* `make plist`
* OpenBSD::PackageModule::Fetch::Gem
* OpenBSD::PackageModule::Fetch::PyPy
